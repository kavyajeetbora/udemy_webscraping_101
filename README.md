[course link](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-scraping-with-python-using-requests-lxml-splash/)

Web Scraping for absolute beginners with Python using Requests, the powerful LXML and Splash for JavaScript websites

What I have learnt from this course:
- LXML core fundamentals
- XPath & CSS selectors
- How send HTTP requests with Python
- Scraping HTML web pages
- Scraping multiple pages using recursion
- Scraping APIs
- Splash HTTP API
- Scraping JavaScript websites using Splash
- Web scraping best practices
- Building datasets
- ~~Authentication and Login to websites using Requests~~ : 
 
This still needs to be done. As diabling javascript in the web browser was not rendering the mobile version of twitter in the last exercise.
